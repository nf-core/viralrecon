## Introduction

**nfcore/viralrecon** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used to perform assembly and intrahost/low-frequency variant calling for viral samples. The pipeline currently supports metagenomics and amplicon sequencing data derived from the Illumina sequencing platform.

This pipeline is a re-implementation of the [SARS_Cov2_consensus-nf](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/SARS_Cov2_consensus-nf) and [SARS_Cov2_assembly-nf](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/SARS_Cov2_assembly-nf) pipelines initially developed by [Sarai Varona](https://github.com/svarona) and [Sara Monzon](https://github.com/saramonzon) from [BU-ISCIII](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII). Porting both of these pipelines to nf-core was an international collaboration between numerous contributors and developers, led by [Harshil Patel](https://github.com/drpatelh) from the [The Bioinformatics & Biostatistics Group](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/science-technology-platforms/bioinformatics-and-biostatistics/) at [The Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/), London. We appreciated the need to have a portable, reproducible and scalable pipeline for the analysis of COVID-19 sequencing samples and so the Avengers Assembled! Please come and join us and add yourself to the contributor list :)

We have integrated a number of options in the pipeline to allow you to run specific aspects of the workflow if you so wish. For example, you can skip all of the assembly steps with the `--skip_assembly` parameter. See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline. Please click [here](https://raw.githack.com/nf-core/viralrecon/master/docs/html/multiqc_report.html) to see an example MultiQC report generated using the parameters defined in [this](../conf/test_full.config) file to run the pipeline on [samples](https://zenodo.org/record/3735111) which were prepared from the [ncov-2019 ARTIC Network V1 amplicon set](https://artic.network/ncov-2019) and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform in 301bp paired-end format.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Quick Start

i. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

ii. Install either [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility (please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))

iii. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda/institute>
```

> Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.

iv. Start running your own analysis!

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/viralrecon -profile <docker/singularity/conda/institute> --input samplesheet.csv --genome 'NC_045512.2' -profile docker
```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

## Credits

nf-core/viralrecon was originally written by Sarai Varona, Miguel Juliá and Sara Monzon from [BU-ISCIII](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII) and co-ordinated by Isabel Cuesta for the [Institute of Health Carlos III](https://eng.isciii.es/eng.isciii.es/Paginas/Inicio.html), Spain. Through collaboration with the nf-core community the pipeline has now been updated substantially to include additional processing steps, to standardise inputs/outputs and to improve the pipeline reporting.
