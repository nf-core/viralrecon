## Nanopore: Preprocessing

A file called `summary_variants_metrics_mqc.csv` containing a selection of read alignment and variant calling metrics will be saved in the `multiqc/<CALLER>/` output directory which is determined by the `--artic_minion_caller` parameter (Default: `nanopolish/`). The same metrics will also be added to the top of the MultiQC report.

### Nanopore: pycoQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pycoqc/`
  - `*.html` and `.json` file that includes a run summary and graphical representation of various QC metrics including distribution of read length, distribution of read quality scores, mean read quality per sequence length, output per channel over experiment time and percentage of reads per barcode.

</details>

[PycoQC](https://github.com/a-slide/pycoQC) compute metrics and generate QC plots using the sequencing summary information generated by basecalling/demultiplexing tools such as Guppy e.g. distribution of read length, read length over time, number of reads per barcode and other general stats.

### Nanopore: artic guppyplex

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `guppyplex/`
  - `*.fastq.gz` files generated by aggregate pre-demultiplexed reads from MinKNOW/Guppy. These files are not saved by default but can be via a custom config file such as the one below.

```nextflow
params {
    modules {
        'nanopore_artic_guppyplex' {
            publish_files = ['fastq.gz':'']
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

The [artic guppyplex](https://artic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/) tool from the [ARTIC field bioinformatics pipeline](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics) is used to perform length filtering of the demultiplexed Nanopore reads obtained per barcode. This essentially filters out chimeric reads that may be generated by the ARTIC protocol. The pipeline uses a default minimum and maximum read length of 400 and 700, respectively as tailored for the [nCoV-2019 primer set](https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html). However, you may need to adjust these for different primer schemes e.g. by using the minimum length of the amplicons (`--min-length`) as well as the maximum length plus 200 (`--max-length`).

### Nanopore: NanoPlot

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `nanoplot/<SAMPLE>/`
  - Per-sample `*.html` files for QC metrics and individual `*.png` image files for plots.

</details>

[NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot) it a tool that can be used to produce general quality metrics from various Nanopore-based input files including fastq files e.g. quality score distribution, read lengths and other general stats.

**NB:** The value of `<CALLER>` in the output directory name above is determined by the `--artic_minion_caller` parameter (Default: 'nanopolish').

</details>

The [artic minion](https://artic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/) tool from the [ARTIC field bioinformatics pipeline](https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics) is used to align reads, call variants and to generate the consensus sequence. By default, artic minion uses [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) to align the reads to the viral genome, however you can use [BWA](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) instead using the `--artic_minion_aligner bwa` parameter. Similarly, the default variant caller used by artic minion is [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish), however, you can use [Medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) instead via the `--artic_minion_caller medaka` parameter. Medaka is faster than Nanopolish, performs mostly the same and can be run directly from `fastq` input files as opposed to requiring the `fastq`, `fast5` and `sequencing_summary.txt` files required to run Nanopolish. You must provide the appropriate [Medaka model](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka#models) via the `--artic_minion_medaka_model` parameter if using `--artic_minion_caller medaka`.

</details>

[Freyja](https://github.com/andersen-lab/Freyja) is a tool to recover relative lineage abundances from mixed SARS-CoV-2 samples from a sequencing dataset (BAM aligned to the Hu-1 reference). The method uses lineage-determining mutational "barcodes" derived from the [UShER](https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) global phylogenetic tree as a basis set to solve the constrained (unit sum, non-negative) de-mixing problem.

### Nanopore: ASCIIGenome

</details>

As described in the documentation, [ASCIIGenome](https://asciigenome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a command-line genome browser that can be run from a terminal window and is solely based on ASCII characters. The closest program to ASCIIGenome is probably [samtools tview](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-tview.html) but ASCIIGenome offers much more flexibility, similar to popular GUI viewers like the [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) browser. We are using the batch processing mode of ASCIIGenome in this pipeline to generate individual screenshots for all of the variant sites reported for each sample in the VCF files. This is incredibly useful to be able to quickly QC the variants called by the pipeline without having to tediously load all of the relevant tracks into a conventional genome browser. Where possible, the BAM read alignments, VCF variant file, primer BED file and GFF annotation track will be represented in the screenshot for contextual purposes. The screenshot below shows a SNP called relative to the MN908947.3 SARS-CoV-2 reference genome that overlaps the ORF7a protein and the nCoV-2019_91_LEFT primer from the ARIC v3 protocol.

</details>

![MultiQC - FastQC adapter content plot](images/mqc_fastqc_adapter.png)

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from pycoQC, samtools, mosdepth, BCFTools, SnpEff and QUAST.

The default [`multiqc config file`](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/assets/multiqc_config_nanopore.yaml) has been written in a way in which to structure these QC metrics to make them more interpretable in the final report.

The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

An example MultiQC report generated from a full-sized dataset can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/results).

## Illumina: Preprocessing

### cat

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastq/`
  - `*.merged.fastq.gz`: These files are not saved by default but can be via a custom config file such as the one below.

```nextflow
params {
    modules {
        'illumina_cat_fastq' {
            publish_files = null
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

If multiple libraries/runs have been provided for the same sample in the input samplesheet (e.g. to increase sequencing depth) then these will be merged at the very beginning of the pipeline in order to have consistent sample naming throughout the pipeline. Please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/usage#illumina-samplesheet-format) to see how to specify these samples in the input samplesheet.

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastqc/raw/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

**NB:** The FastQC plots in this directory are generated relative to the raw, input reads. They may contain adapter sequence and regions of low quality. To see how your reads look after trimming please refer to the FastQC reports in the `fastqc/trim/` directory.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

### Kraken 2

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `kraken2/`
  - `*.kraken2.report.txt`: Kraken 2 taxonomic report. See [here](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=manual#sample-report-output-format) for a detailed description of the format.

</details>

[Kraken 2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=manual) is a sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to DNA sequences. Kraken 2 examines the k-mers within a query sequence and uses the information within those k-mers to query a database. That database maps k-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain a given k-mer.

We use a Kraken 2 database in this workflow to filter out reads specific to the host genome before performing the _de novo_ assembly steps in the pipeline. This filtering is not performed in the variant calling arm of the pipeline by default but Kraken 2 is still run to obtain an estimate of host reads, however, the filtering can be amended via the `--kraken2_variants_host_filter` parameter.

![MultiQC - Kraken 2 classification plot](images/mqc_kraken2_plot.png)

## Illumina: Variant calling

Unless you are using [UMIs](https://emea.illumina.com/science/sequencing-method-explorer/kits-and-arrays/umi.html) it is not possible to establish whether the fragments you have sequenced from your sample were derived via true biological duplication (i.e. sequencing independent template fragments) or as a result of PCR biases introduced during the library preparation. [picard MarkDuplicates](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037052812-MarkDuplicates-Picard-) isn't run by default because you anticipate high levels of duplication with viral data due to the size of the genome, however, you can activate it by adding `--skip_markduplicates false` to the command you use to run the pipeline. This will only _mark_ the duplicate reads identified amongst the alignments to allow you to guage the overall level of duplication in your samples. You can also choose to remove any reads identified as duplicates via the `--filter_duplicates` parameter.

[iVar](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.md) is a computational package that contains functions broadly useful for viral amplicon-based sequencing. We use iVar in this pipeline to [trim primer sequences](#ivar-trim) for amplicon input data as well as to call variants.

iVar outputs a tsv format which is not compatible with downstream analysis such as annotation using SnpEff. Moreover some issues need to be addressed such as [strand-bias filtering](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar/issues/5) and [the consecutive reporting of variants belonging to the same codon](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar/issues/92). This pipeline uses a custom Python script [ivar_variants_to_vcf.py](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/blob/master/bin/ivar_variants_to_vcf.py) to convert the default iVar output to VCF whilst also addressing both of these issues.

As described in the documentation, [ASCIIGenome](https://asciigenome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a command-line genome browser that can be run from a terminal window and is solely based on ASCII characters. The closest program to ASCIIGenome is probably [samtools tview](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-tview.html) but ASCIIGenome offers much more flexibility, similar to popular GUI viewers like the [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) browser. We are using the batch processing mode of ASCIIGenome in this pipeline to generate individual screenshots for all of the variant sites reported for each sample in the VCF files. This is incredibly useful to be able to quickly QC the variants called by the pipeline without having to tediously load all of the relevant tracks into a conventional genome browser. Where possible, the BAM read alignments, VCF variant file, primer BED file and GFF annotation track will be represented in the screenshot for contextual purposes. The screenshot below shows a SNP called relative to the MN908947.3 SARS-CoV-2 reference genome that overlaps the ORF7a protein and the nCoV-2019_91_LEFT primer from the ARIC v3 protocol.

  - `kraken2_db/`: Kraken 2 database for host genome.
  - `snpeff_db/`: SnpEff database for viral genome.
  - `snpeff.config`: SnpEff config file for viral genome.
  - Unzipped genome fasta file for viral genome
  - Unzipped genome annotation GFF file for viral genome

A number of genome-specific files are generated by the pipeline because they are required for the downstream processing of the results. If the `--save_reference` parameter is provided then the Bowtie 2 alignment indices, BLAST and Kraken 2 databases downloaded/generated by the pipeline will be saved in the `genome/` directory. It is recommended to use the `--save_reference` parameter if you are using the pipeline to build a Kraken 2 database for the host genome. This can be quite a time-consuming process and it permits their reuse for future runs of the pipeline or for other purposes.

# Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
