## Preprocessing

### parallel-fastq-dump

[parallel-fastq-dump](https://github.com/rvalieris/parallel-fastq-dump) is used within the pipeline to automatically download and create FastQ files via user provided IDs from the [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

**Output files:**

* `preprocess/sra/`
  * `*.fastq.gz`: Paired-end/single-end reads downloaded and extracted from the SRA.
* `preprocess/sra/log/`
  * `*.fastq_dump.log`: Log file generated from stdout.

> **NB:** Downloaded FastQ files will only be saved in the results directory if the `--save_sra_fastq` parameter is supplied.
> **NB:** If downloading data from the SRA, a metadata (`*.sra_runinfo.txt`) and warnings (`*.sra_warnings.txt`) file is also saved in the `pipeline_info/` directory.

### FastQC

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, the per base sequence content (%T/A/G/C). You get information about adapter contamination and other overrepresented sequences.

For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

![MultiQC - FastQC per base sequence plot](images/mqc_fastqc_plot.png)

**Output files:**

* `preprocess/fastqc/`
  * `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
* `preprocess/fastqc/zips/`
  * `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

> **NB:** The FastQC plots in this directory are generated relative to the raw, input reads. They may contain adapter sequence and regions of low quality. To see how your reads look after trimming look at the FastQC reports in the `preprocess/fastp/fastqc/` directory.

### fastp

[fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) is a tool designed to provide fast all-in-one preprocessing for FastQ files. It has been developed in C++ with multithreading support to afford high performance. fastp is used in this pipeline for adapter trimming and quality filtering.

**Output files:**

* `preprocess/fastp/`
  * `*.fastp.html`: Trimming report in html format.
  * `*.fastp.json`: Trimming report in json format.

![MultiQC - fastp filtered reads plot](images/mqc_fastp_plot.png)

> **NB:** Post-trimmed FastQ files will only be saved in the results directory if the `--save_trimmed` parameter is supplied.

### cat

The initial QC and adapter trimming for each sample is performed at the run-level e.g. if a sample has been sequenced more than once to increase sequencing depth. This has the advantage of being able to assess each library individually, and the ability to process multiple libraries from the same sample in parallel. If applicable, these samples are subsequently merged using the Linux cat command after the fastp adapter trimming step. There is currently no option to save the merged FastQ files to the results directory.

## Variant calling

### Bowtie 2

[Bowtie 2](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes.

[picard-tools](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html) is a set of command-line tools for manipulating high-throughput sequencing data. We use picard-tools in this pipeline to obtain mapping and coverage metrics. If `--protocol amplicon` is set then these metrics will be obtained from the iVar trimmed alignments as opposed to the original Bowtie 2 alignments.

**Output files:**

* `variants/<bowtie2/ivar>/picard_metrics/`  
  Alignment QC files from picard CollectMultipleMetrics and the metrics file from CollectWgsMetrics in `*_metrics` text format and plotted in `*.pdf` format.

### VarScan 2, BCFTools, BEDTools

VarScan is a platform-independent software tool developed at the Genome Institute, Washington University to detect variants in NGS data. SAMtools was used to generate the a Pileup file which was then passed to [VarScan 2](http://varscan.sourceforge.net/) in order to call both high and low frequency variants.

[BCFtools](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the VCF and its binary counterpart BCF. BCFTools was used in this pipeline to obtain basic statistics from the VCF output generated by VarScan 2 (and iVar), and to generate the consensus sequence by integrating high frequency variant calls into the reference genome.

[BEDTools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a swiss-army knife of tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. In this pipeline we used `bedtools genomecov` to compute the per-base mapped read coverage in bedGraph format, and `bedtools maskfasta` to mask sequences in a Fasta file based on intervals defined in a feature file. This may be useful for creating your own masked genome file based on custom annotations or for masking all but your target regions when aligning sequence data from a targeted capture experiment.

Kraken examines the k-mers within a query sequence and uses the information within those k-mers to query a database. That database maps k-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain a given k-mer.

We used a Kraken2 database in this workflow to filter out reads specific to the host genome. The remainder of the reads are then passed to numerous de novo assembly algorithms in order to reconstruct the viral genome assembly.

## Workflow reporting and genomes

### MultiQC

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarizing all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in within the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from FastQC, fastp, cutadapt, Bowtie 2, samtools flagstat, samtools idxstats, samtools stats, picard CollectMultipleMetrics and CollectWgsMetrics, BCFTools stats, SnpEff and QUAST.

The default [`multiqc config file`](../assets/multiqc_config.yaml) has been written in a way in which to structure these QC metrics to make them more interpretable in the final report.

The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

**Output files:**

* `multiqc/`  
  * `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  * `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  * `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

### Reference genome files

A number of genome-specific files are generated by the pipeline because they are required for the downstream processing of the results. If the `--save_reference` parameter is provided then the Bowtie 2 alignment indices, BLAST and Kraken2 databases generated by the pipeline will be saved in the `genome/` directory. It is recommended to use the `--save_reference` parameter if you are using the pipeline to build a Kraken2 database for the host genome. This can be quite a time-consuming process and it permits their reuse for future runs of the pipeline or for other purposes.

**Output files:**

* `genome/`  
  * `Bowtie2Index/`: Bowtie 2 index for viral genome.
  * `BlastDB/`: BLAST database for viral genome.
  * `kraken2_<KRAKEN2_DB_NAME>/`: Kraken2 database for host genome.

### Pipeline information

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.

**Output files:**

* `pipeline_info/`
  * Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  * Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.csv`.
  * Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.pass.csv`.
  * If downloading data from the SRA, a metadata (`*.sra_runinfo.txt`) and warnings (`*.sra_warnings.txt`) file is also saved in this directory.
  * Documentation for interpretation of results in HTML format: `results_description.html`.
