## Preprocessing

### parallel-fastq-dump

Please see the [usage docs](usage.md#supported-public-repository-ids) for a list of supported public repository identifiers and how to provide them to the pipeline. The final sample information for all identifiers is obtained from the ENA which provides direct download links for FastQ files as well as their associated md5sums. If download links exist, the files will be downloaded by FTP otherwise they will be downloaded using [`parallel-fastq-dump`](https://github.com/rvalieris/parallel-fastq-dump).

**Output files:**

* `preprocess/sra/`
  * `*.fastq.gz`: Paired-end/single-end reads downloaded and extracted from the SRA.
* `preprocess/sra/log/`
  * `*.fastq_dump.log`: Log file generated from stdout.

> **NB:** Downloaded FastQ files will only be saved in the results directory if the `--save_sra_fastq` parameter is supplied.  
> **NB:** A metadata (`*.sra_runinfo.txt`) and warnings (`*.sra_warnings.txt`) file is also saved in the `pipeline_info/` directory.

### FastQC

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

**Output files:**

* `preprocess/fastqc/`
  * `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
* `preprocess/fastqc/zips/`
  * `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="images/mqc_fastqc_plot.png" alt="MultiQC - FastQC per base sequence plot"/>
</p>

> **NB:** The FastQC plots in this directory are generated relative to the raw, input reads. They may contain adapter sequence and regions of low quality. To see how your reads look after trimming please refer to the FastQC reports in the `preprocess/fastp/fastqc/` directory.

### fastp

[fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) is a tool designed to provide fast, all-in-one preprocessing for FastQ files. It has been developed in C++ with multithreading support for higher performance. fastp is used in this pipeline for standard adapter trimming and quality filtering.

</p>

> **NB:** Post-trimmed FastQ files will only be saved in the results directory if the `--save_trimmed` parameter is supplied.

### cat

The initial QC and adapter trimming for each sample is performed at the run-level e.g. if a sample has been sequenced more than once to increase sequencing depth. This has the advantage of being able to assess each library individually, and the ability to process multiple libraries from the same sample in parallel. If applicable, these samples are subsequently merged using the Linux `cat` command after the fastp adapter trimming step.

## Variant calling

### Bowtie 2

[Bowtie 2](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes.

We use picard-tools in this pipeline to obtain mapping and coverage metrics. If `--protocol amplicon` is set then these metrics will be obtained from the iVar trimmed alignments as opposed to the original Bowtie 2 alignments.

**Output files:**

* `variants/<bowtie2/ivar>/picard_metrics/`  
  Alignment QC files from picard CollectMultipleMetrics and the metrics file from CollectWgsMetrics in `*_metrics` text format and plotted in `*.pdf` format.

</p>

### VarScan 2, BCFTools, BEDTools

[VarScan 2](http://dkoboldt.github.io/varscan/) is a platform-independent software tool to detect variants in NGS data. In this pipeline, VarScan 2 is used in conjunction with SAMtools in order to call both high and low frequency variants.

[BCFtools](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) is a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in [VCF](https://vcftools.github.io/specs.html) and its binary counterpart BCF format. BCFTools is used in the variant calling and *de novo* assembly steps of this pipeline to obtain basic statistics from the VCF output. It is also used in the VarScan 2 variant calling branch of the pipeline to generate a consensus sequence by integrating high frequency variant calls into the reference genome.

[BEDTools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a swiss-army knife of tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. In this pipeline we use `bedtools genomecov` to compute the per-base mapped read coverage in bedGraph format, and `bedtools maskfasta` to mask sequences in a Fasta file based on intervals defined in a feature file. This may be useful for creating your own masked genome file based on custom annotations or for masking all but your target regions when aligning sequence data from a targeted capture experiment.

**Output files:**

## De novo assembly

### Cutadapt

In the variant calling branch of the pipeline we are using [iVar trim](#ivar-trim) to remove primer sequences from the aligned BAM files for amplicon data. Since in the *de novo* assembly branch we don't align the reads, we use [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html) as an alternative option to remove and clean the primer sequences directly from FastQ files.

### Kraken 2

[Kraken 2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=manual) is a sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to DNA sequences. Kraken 2 examines the k-mers within a query sequence and uses the information within those k-mers to query a database. That database maps k-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain a given k-mer.

We used a Kraken 2 database in this workflow to filter out reads specific to the host genome. The remainder of the reads are then passed to numerous *de novo* assembly algorithms in order to reconstruct the viral genome.

**Output files:**

* `assembly/kraken2/`
  * `*.host.fastq.gz`: Reads that were classified to the host database.
  * `*.viral.fastq.gz`: Reads that were unclassified to the host database.

### Minimap2, seqwish, vg

TODO: Add documentation here about , , , .

[Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) is a versatile sequence alignment program that aligns DNA or mRNA sequences against a large reference database. 

[seqwish](https://github.com/ekg/seqwish) implements a lossless conversion from pairwise alignments between sequences to a variation graph encoding the sequences and their alignments. This algorithm uses a series of disk-backed sorts and passes over the alignment and sequence inputs to allow the graph to be constructed from very large inputs that are commonly encountered when working with large numbers of noisy input sequences.

[vg](https://github.com/vgteam/vg) generates variation graphs that provide a succinct encoding of the sequences of many genomes. A vg variation graph is composed of: nodes, which are labeled by sequences and ids; edges, which connect two nodes via either of their respective ends; paths, describe genomes, sequence alignments, and annotations (such as gene models and transcripts) as walks through nodes connected by edges

>**Is this still relevant?**

[Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage) is a GUI program that allows users to interact with the assembly graphs made by de novo assemblers.

## Workflow reporting and genomes

### MultiQC

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarizing all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from FastQC, fastp, Cutadapt, Bowtie 2, samtools flagstat, samtools idxstats, samtools stats, picard CollectMultipleMetrics and CollectWgsMetrics, BCFTools stats, SnpEff and QUAST.

The default [`multiqc config file`](../assets/multiqc_config.yaml) has been written in a way in which to structure these QC metrics to make them more interpretable in the final report.

The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

**Output files:**

* `multiqc/`  
  * `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  * `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  * `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

### Reference genome files

A number of genome-specific files are generated by the pipeline because they are required for the downstream processing of the results. If the `--save_reference` parameter is provided then the Bowtie 2 alignment indices, BLAST and Kraken 2 databases downloaded/generated by the pipeline will be saved in the `genome/` directory. It is recommended to use the `--save_reference` parameter if you are using the pipeline to build a Kraken 2 database for the host genome. This can be quite a time-consuming process and it permits their reuse for future runs of the pipeline or for other purposes.

**Output files:**

* `genome/`  
  * `Bowtie2Index/`: Bowtie 2 index for viral genome.
  * `BlastDB/`: BLAST database for viral genome.
  * `kraken2_<KRAKEN2_DB_NAME>/`: Kraken 2 database for host genome.

### Pipeline information

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.

**Output files:**

* `pipeline_info/`
  * Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  * Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.csv`.
  * Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.pass.csv`.
  * If downloading data from the SRA, a metadata (`*.sra_runinfo.txt`) and warnings (`*.sra_warnings.txt`) file is also saved in this directory.
  * Documentation for interpretation of results in HTML format: `results_description.html`.
