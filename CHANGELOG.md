> **NB:** Parameter has been **updated** if both old and new parameter information is present.
> **NB:** Parameter has been **added** if just the new parameter information is present.
> **NB:** Parameter has been **removed** if new parameter information isn't present.

### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is now using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference.

| Dependency | Old version | New version |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `cutadapt` |             | 4.6         |
| `fastp`    | 0.23.2      | 0.23.4      |
| `freyja`   |             | 1.5.0       |
| `multiqc`  | 1.14        | 1.19        |
| `fastp`    | 0.23.2      | 0.23.4      |
| `cutadapt` |             | 4.6         |

> **NB:** Dependency has been **updated** if both old and new version information is present.

## [[2.0](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/releases/tag/2.0)] - 2021-05-13

### :warning: Major enhancements

- Pipeline has been re-implemented in [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html)
- All software containers are now exclusively obtained from [Biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry)
- Updated minimum Nextflow version to `v21.04.0` (see [nextflow#572](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/1964))
- [BCFtools](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html) and [iVar](https://github.com/andersen-lab/ivar) will be run by default for Illumina metagenomics and amplicon data, respectively. However, this behaviour can be customised with the `--callers` parameter.
- Variant graph processes to call variants relative to the reference genome directly from _de novo_ assemblies have been deprecated and removed
- Variant calling with Varscan 2 has been deprecated and removed due to [licensing restrictions](https://github.com/dkoboldt/varscan/issues/12)
- New tools:
  - [Pangolin](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin) for lineage analysis

### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is now using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference.

## [[1.0.0](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/releases/tag/1.0.0)] - 2020-06-01

Initial release of nf-core/viralrecon, created with the [nf-core](http://nf-co.re/) template.

This pipeline is a re-implementation of the [SARS_Cov2_consensus-nf](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/SARS_Cov2_consensus-nf) and [SARS_Cov2_assembly-nf](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII/SARS_Cov2_assembly-nf) pipelines initially developed by [Sarai Varona](https://github.com/svarona) and [Sara Monzon](https://github.com/saramonzon) from [BU-ISCIII](https://github.com/BU-ISCIII). Porting both of these pipelines to nf-core was an international collaboration between numerous contributors and developers, led by [Harshil Patel](https://github.com/drpatelh) from the [The Bioinformatics & Biostatistics Group](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/science-technology-platforms/bioinformatics-and-biostatistics/) at [The Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/), London. We appreciated the need to have a portable, reproducible and scalable pipeline for the analysis of COVID-19 sequencing samples and so the Avengers Assembled!
